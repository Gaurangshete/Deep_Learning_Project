 Deep Learning Image Classification Project Description
Task Overview
Develop and implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for automated image classification using deep learning techniques. The model will be trained to recognize and categorize images into predefined classes, demonstrating the complete machine learning pipeline from data preprocessing to model deployment.

Project Objectives
Primary Goal:
Build a functional deep learning model capable of classifying images with high accuracy using TensorFlow/Keras framework.
